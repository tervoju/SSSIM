what info has to be collected:
    - time stamp + GPS (base talk state)    - done
    - time stamp + depth                done
    - sea flow
    - time stamp + ping messages    done
    - time stamp + other float messages done


collect 
    all positions                                       done
    all pings                                           done
    all gps positions from other floats (if possible)   done and estimates

    
estimate position
    - kalman based on previous positions?               not working
    - pings based on estimated positions?               done

calculate estimates with integrated kalman
- branch?
- precomms
